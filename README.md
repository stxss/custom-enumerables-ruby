# Custom Enumerable Project

### Methods

The following table has the methods you will need to implement along with their associated specs, as outlined in the project instructions. The methods in the Enumerable module only need to work with Arrays, but you can challenge yourself and try to make them work for Hashes as well.

| Method                          | Spec File                       | Notes                                                                 |

| `Array#my_each`                 | spec/my_each_spec.rb            | You will define my_each on the Array class in `lib/my_enumerables.rb` |
| `Enumerable#my_each_with_index` | spec/my_each_with_index_spec.rb |                                                                       |
